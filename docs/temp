XXX DEPRECATED 

This program contains an importable function get_baselines().  This function takes 
HERA position information from hsa7458_v001.py.  If there is no position data for an 
antenna in hsa7458_v001.py (i.e., the antenna does not yet exist) the z-coordinate 
should be set to -1 in hsa7458_v001.py.  This will make sure that those antennae 
are not used in this program.

If hsa7458_v001.py is not imported, hardcoded position information will 
be used for 19 antennae.

This position information is used to calculate all unique baselines, and 
find all pairs of antennae with each baseline.  The output of this program is a 
Python dictionary. Each key is a unique baseline, and each value is a list of tuples.  
Each tuple contains two numbers that represent antennae.
Example:
{14.6: [(9, 20),(9, 22),(9, 53), ...
...
...

Antennae 9 and 20, 9 and 22, and 9 and 53 are separated by 14.6 meters.
All baselines are stored as floats. All antennae are stored as ints.

When some antennae aren't functioning properly the command line argument --ex_ants or -x can be used.
Example:
python2.7 baseline_lengths.py --ex_ants=80,104,96
python2.7 baseline_lengths.py --x=80,104,96

Both of those commands will exclude antennae 80, 104, and 96 when calculating baselines.
